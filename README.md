This plugin automates a workflow for a templated weekly note. 

### Workflow
1. Weekly notes are accesable via a side bar icon
2. Clicking the icon will open the note for the current week
3. If a note for the current week does not exisit it will be created form the configurable template, unfinished todos from the previous week will be carried forward. 


### Configuration 
This plugin has two optional settings: 
1. Template path - if set new notes will use this template. paths are of the form "{name}.md". Template can contain a {{TODO}} tag where you would like todos to be placed. 
2. Logs Directory - if set weekly notes will be stored in this directory. Paths should end with a "/"
